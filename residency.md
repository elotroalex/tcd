## T&T artist selected for first TCD digital residency

<small>July 13, 2022</small>

**Marinna Shareef of Trinidad and Tobago has been selected for The
Caribbean Digital's inaugural Virtual Artist's Residency.**

Launched in early 2022, and expected to run annually for four years, the
virtual residency programme is aimed at artists of the Caribbean and its
diasporas who work in digital media. It offers a cash stipend of
US\$5,000 to support six months of part-time research and creative work,
structured mentorship by artist and Alice Yard co-director Christopher
Cozier, and a final presentation of the artist's work at The Caribbean
Digital's conference, hosted in November this year by the University of
Puerto Rico.

Shareef --- an early-career artist who graduated in 2019 with a BA in
visual art from the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine ---
will also benefit from a series of virtual studio visits by professional
curators or critics, and the commissioning and online publication of an
essay documenting her work during the residency.

The Caribbean Digital Virtual Artist's Residency is hosted by The
Caribbean Digital (TCD) in partnership with Alice Yard, and is sponsored
by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

This residency is intended to support the development of "born-digital"
creative work primarily based in digital media and tools, and encourage
collaboration and cross-fertilisation between artistic practice and
Caribbean Digital Humanities.

"Since the launch of TCD in 2014, we've deliberately incorporated the
work of visual artists from the Caribbean and its diaspora each year,"
says TCD co-founder Professor Kelly Baker Josephs. "Creative arts offer
a form of knowledge production that takes up the same concerns academics
engage with, offering alternative modes of expression to audiences that
extend beyond the academy. We hope the residency may offer a model for
how other scholarly projects can engage with artistic practitioners as
co-creators of knowledge."

"'Digital art' is a form of practice whose boundaries are constantly
shifting," says Alice Yard co-director Nicholas Laughlin. "We received
thirty-six applications for this inaugural residency, and the range of
forms and technologies proposed by the artists was fascinating.
Selecting just one of them was not easy, but we're happy that the 2022
resident is an artist early in her career who we believe will truly
benefit from the opportunity, and whose practice brings together
elements of the virtual and the physical. We're excited to experience
and share the work that will come out of this residency."

The Caribbean Digital conference (TCD) is an international event hosted
annually at locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014.
Alternating between larger conferences and smaller symposia, TCD has
created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist
digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable
conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells.

Alice Yard is a contemporary art collective based at Granderson Lab in
Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Founded in 2006, Alice Yard
curates and hosts artists' projects and residencies, with the support of
an international network of collaborators.
