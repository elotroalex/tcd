## Call For Applications | 2022

The Caribbean Digital Virtual Artist's Residency is a program to support
Caribbean artists working in digital media. The residency is hosted by
the annual Caribbean Digital (TCD) conference in partnership with Alice
Yard, and is sponsored by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation

Beginning in 2022, and for a period of four years, TCD and Alice Yard
are partnering to create an annual virtual residency programme for
artists of the Caribbean and its diasporas who work in digital media.
The residency aims to facilitate the development of new artworks in
digital media that investigate ideas and practices in Caribbean Digital
Humanities, and engage with scholars in the TCD network and community.

The residency consists of:

-   a cash stipend of US\$5,000 to support six months of part-time research and creative work, to begin in June 2022;
-   curatorial mentorship by artist and Alice Yard co-director Christopher Cozier;
-   two virtual studio visits by professional curators or critics;
-   the commissioning and online publication of a critical text by a professional art writer to document the artist's work and process;
-   arranged travel and accommodation to present the resulting work at TCD's annual conference in December 2022.

During the virtual residency, the artist will remain based at their
usual location, interacting with the administrators, mentor, and TCD
community members via standard online media and tools, with the
understanding that the artist will maintain regular contact through
scheduled meetings and check-ins.

This residency is intended to support the development of "born-digital"
creative work primarily based in digital media and tools, rather than
analog work that is digitized merely for presentation or storage.
Artists may work in media including and not limited to images, sound,
and text. Also integral to the residency is the artist's engagement with
Caribbean Digital Humanities, a multidisciplinary field of study that
brings digital technologies into the research, analysis, visualization,
and application of the traditional humanities. During the residency, the
artist will be expected to engage in dialogue with Caribbean Digital
Humanities scholars with the aim of mutual enrichment of their creative
and research practices.

The [Caribbean Digital conference](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net) (TCD) is an international event hosted annually at locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014. Alternating between larger conferences and smaller symposia, TCD has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells.

[Alice Yard](http://aliceyard.blogspot.com/) is a contemporary art collective based at Granderson Lab in Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Founded in 2006, Alice Yard curates and hosts artists' projects and residencies, with the support of an international network of collaborators.
