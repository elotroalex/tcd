<p>This collaborative curation of digital resources concerning the Caribbean and its diasporas engages the community in compiling entries in an open, shared online dataset. Over the course of two months in 2020, contributors co-produced an online directory that allows users to browse, preview, and search a comprehensive, open-source bibliographical archive. This year, we continue the tradition by updating the directory.</p>

<p>If you would like to be a part of this tradition, you can add projects directly to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PfgI0GrQR60gwRFVIZmZtWae9JyAMpZNFOZRe5xsMsg/edit#gid=0">our open data sheet</a>.
