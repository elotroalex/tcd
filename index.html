  <p>The Caribbean Digital conference (TCD) turns 10 years old this year! Come <a href="/cfp" target="_blank">celebrate with us in New Haven in December!</a></p>
  
  <p>TCD is an annual international event, held in locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014. Alternating between events convened via open invitation in response to a widely-circulated CFP, and smaller events convened exclusively by invitation, respectively, TCD has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells. The work done in preparation for this gathering and/or produced in its wake has led to the publication (in <a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/"><em>archipelagos journal</em></a> alone) of more than 30 peer-reviewed scholarly articles, and inspired and contributed to many digital projects in Caribbean Studies. In addition, the conference has produced its own family of digital projects, including a collectively generated <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/1914/20151224034325/http://caribbeandigital.cdrs.columbia.edu/?page_id=113"><span class="underline">bibliography</span></a>, a collective <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/translation/"><span class="underline">translation</span></a>, a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/"><span class="underline">keywords</span></a> project, and a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/caridischo/"><span class="underline">directory</span></a> of Caribbean digital scholarship.</p>
