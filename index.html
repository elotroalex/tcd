  <h1>the caribbean digital</h1>

  <p>The Caribbean Digital conference (TCD) is an anual international event, held in locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014. Alternating between events convened via open invitation in response to a widely-circulated CFP, and smaller events convened exclusively by invitation, respectively, TCD has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells. The work done in preparation for this gathering and/or produced in its wake has led to the publication (in <a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/">archipelagos journal</a> alone) of more than 30 peer-reviewed scholarly articles and digital projects and to the development of several ongoing digital artefacts, including a collectively generated <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/1914/20151224034325/http://caribbeandigital.cdrs.columbia.edu/?page_id=113"><span class="underline">bibliography</span></a>, a collective <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/translation/"><span class="underline">translation</span></a>, a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/"><span class="underline">keywords</span></a> project, and a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/caridischo/"><span class="underline">directory</span></a> of the field of Caribbean digital studies.</p>
