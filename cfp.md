## The Caribbean Digital XII

### Call for applications

4-5 December 2025\\
Northeastern University\\
Boston, MA

**Deadline for proposals:** June 30, 2025

Beginning in 2014, The Caribbean Digital has sought to create a
generative, multidisciplinary space within which to engage critically
with the digital as practice and as a historicized societal phenomenon,
reflecting on the challenges and opportunities presented by the media
technologies that ever more intensely reconfigure the social and
geo-political contours of the Caribbean and its diasporas. In the
twelfth iteration of this gathering, we are thrilled to continue these
conversations via collaboration with [the Early Caribbean Digital
Archive](https://ecda.northeastern.edu/), the [Africana
Studies Program](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/africana/),
and the [NULab for Humanities and Computational Social
Science](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/) at
Northeastern University.

The continued need for rigorous and ethical engagement with the digital
"revolution" is especially immediate among the people of the Caribbean
and its diasporas. Information technology remains a significant way
people connect and frame pressing social problems and political
aspirations. Moreover, the Internet is analogous in important ways to
the Caribbean itself as a dynamic and fluid cultural space: it is
generated from disparate places and by disparate peoples; it
fundamentally challenges the geographical and physical barriers that
disrupt or disallow connection; and it places others and elsewhere in
relentless relation. Yet while we celebrate these opportunities for
connectedness, we must ensure that the digital realm undermines and
confronts rather than re-inscribes forms of silencing and exclusion in
the Caribbean.

Following conversations that animated past events, we are looking
forward in this twelfth public forum to continuing our critical
engagement with presentations that might evoke any of the following
topics and the ways they might intersect with each other:

- Gendered and class dimensions of the digital in the Caribbean
- The connection between digital technologies and practices of the Caribbean "folk"
- World-building -- Reimagining through and as the digital
- Citizenship, mobility, migration, and the digital
- Material, audio, and visual culture connected to the digital
- 3-D imaging and the digital
- Considering the politics and ethics of AI in/and the Caribbean
- Digital pedagogies, curriculum, and/or classroom or community education activities
- Archives in and about the Caribbean
- Languages as technology and structures of the digital
- The relationship between the aesthetics of absence and the digital
- Minimal computing as a form of digital resistance
- Digital counter-publics/counter-narratives
- Digital mapping and questions of place, space, and belonging
- Collaborative/community-engaged digital projects
- Relationships between digital and physical resistance
- Digital access and the aesthetics/politics of digital ownership
- Digital possibilities and imaginaries
- Digital knowledge-making and decolonial epistemologies

Both traditional conference papers and multimedia presentations on these
or related topics are welcome. We also welcome virtual synchronous
participation by presenters who cannot travel to Boston to attend the
event. Participants from this forum will be encouraged to submit their
work to
[_archipelagos_](https://archipelagosjournal.org/), an
interactive, born-digital, print-possible, peer-reviewed publication.

The 2025 conference is being held in the loving memory of Dr. √Ångel
David Nieves (1971 -- 2023). At the time of his passing, Dr. Nieves was
Dean's Professor of Public and Digital Humanities, Professor of Africana
Studies and History, and Director of the Humanities Center at
Northeastern University in Boston. Dr. Nieves also held positions at
Hamilton College, Yale University, San Diego State University, and many
other institutions. Dr. Nieves's vivacious presence, teaching, and work
left a lasting impression on everyone. His books, _An Architecture of
Education: African American Women Design the New South_ (2018) and _'We
Shall Independent Be:' African American Place Making and the Struggle to
Claim Space in the U.S._ (edited with Leslie Alexander, 2008) were
significant explorations into the labors done by of Black feminists that
served to eventually uplift all others. Like his subjects of study,
Nieves, too, believed that all people deserve a good education and
working conditions to lead a good life. His investments in social
justice were total and all-encompassing. As a proud, queer, Brown man
whose roots were in Puerto Rico, he was especially dedicated to
supporting like-minded scholars such as those associated with The
Caribbean Digital. The conference especially welcomes submissions that
engage with the spirit and content of Dr. Nieves' foundational work.

We welcome abstracts of 250-300 words in length. Abstracts should
include name, academic affiliation, contact information, and short bios.
Please submit [using this form] (requires Google
sign-in): [](https://forms.gle/1iB8eZ8F4AhW4a4t8) by **30 June 2025**. Successful applicants will be notified by **30
August 2025**. Travel and accommodations for conference presenters will
be covered.
