<br>

Beginning in 2014, The Caribbean Digital has sought to create a generative, multidisciplinary space within which to engage critically with the digital as practice and as historicized societal phenomenon, reflecting on the challenges and opportunities presented by the media technologies that evermore intensely reconfigure the social and geo-political contours of the Caribbean and its diasporas. We are thrilled, on the tenth anniversary of this gathering, to invite you to Yale University to celebrate with us.

The continued need for rigorous and ethical engagement with the digital “revolution” is especially immediate among the people of the Caribbean and its diasporas and information technology remains a significant way in which people frame pressing social problems and political aspirations. The Internet is analogous in important ways to the Caribbean itself as dynamic and fluid cultural space: it is generated from disparate places and by disparate peoples; it challenges fundamentally the geographical and physical barriers that disrupt or disallow connection; and it places others and elsewheres in relentless relation. Yet while we celebrate these opportunities for connectedness, we also must make certain that the digital realm undermines and confronts rather than re-inscribe forms of silencing and exclusion in the Caribbean.

Following on conversations that animated past events\[archive page\] we look forward during our tenth public forum to continuing our critical engagement with presentations that explicitly evoke:

- the transatlantic, collaborative, and/or interdisciplinary possibilities and limitations of digital technologies in the Caribbean;

- metaphorical linkages between the digital and such Caribbean philosophical, ethical, and aesthetic concepts as \"submarine unity,\" the rhizome, Relation, the spiral, repeating islands, creolization, etc.;

- gendered dimensions of the digital in the Caribbean;

- the connection between digital technologies and practices of the Caribbean "folk";

- specific engagements with digital spaces and/or theories by individual Caribbean artists and intellectuals;

- the ways in which digital technologies have impacted or shaped understandings of specific Caribbean political phenomena (e.g. sovereignty, reparations, transnationalism, migration, etc.);

- structural means of facilitating broad engagement, communication, and accessibility in the Caribbean digital context (cultivation of multilingual spaces, attentiveness to the material/hardware limitations of various populations);

- the ways the digital has brought welcome bibliographic, philological and curatorial attention to endangered or neglected archives in the region.

Both traditional conference papers and integrally multimedia presentations are welcome in any of the languages of the Caribbean. We also welcome virtual synchronous participation by presenters who cannot travel to Connecticut to attend the event. Participants in TCD X are welcome to submit their work to [archipelagos journal](http://archipelagosjournal.org), an interactive, born-digital, print-possible, peer-reviewed publication.

Abstracts of 250 words and a short bio should be sent to Alex Gil, Kaiama L. Glover, and Kelly Baker Josephs (thecaribbeandigital@gmail.com) by **31 August 2023**. Successful applicants will be notified by **30 September 2023**.

## Call For Applications | 2022

The Caribbean Digital Virtual Artist's Residency is a program to support
Caribbean artists working in digital media. The residency is hosted by
the annual Caribbean Digital (TCD) conference in partnership with Alice
Yard, and is sponsored by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation

Beginning in 2022, and for a period of four years, TCD and Alice Yard
are partnering to create an annual virtual residency programme for
artists of the Caribbean and its diasporas who work in digital media.
The residency aims to facilitate the development of new artworks in
digital media that investigate ideas and practices in Caribbean Digital
Humanities, and engage with scholars in the TCD network and community.

The residency consists of:

-   a cash stipend of US\$5,000 to support six months of part-time research and creative work, to begin in June 2022;
-   curatorial mentorship by artist and Alice Yard co-director Christopher Cozier;
-   two virtual studio visits by professional curators or critics;
-   the commissioning and online publication of a critical text by a professional art writer to document the artist's work and process;
-   arranged travel and accommodation to present the resulting work at TCD's annual conference in December 2022.

During the virtual residency, the artist will remain based at their
usual location, interacting with the administrators, mentor, and TCD
community members via standard online media and tools, with the
understanding that the artist will maintain regular contact through
scheduled meetings and check-ins.

This residency is intended to support the development of "born-digital"
creative work primarily based in digital media and tools, rather than
analog work that is digitized merely for presentation or storage.
Artists may work in media including and not limited to images, sound,
and text. Also integral to the residency is the artist's engagement with
Caribbean Digital Humanities, a multidisciplinary field of study that
brings digital technologies into the research, analysis, visualization,
and application of the traditional humanities. During the residency, the
artist will be expected to engage in dialogue with Caribbean Digital
Humanities scholars with the aim of mutual enrichment of their creative
and research practices.

The [Caribbean Digital conference](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net) (TCD) is an international event hosted annually at locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014. Alternating between larger conferences and smaller symposia, TCD has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells.

[Alice Yard](http://aliceyard.blogspot.com/) is a contemporary art collective based at Granderson Lab in Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Founded in 2006, Alice Yard curates and hosts artists' projects and residencies, with the support of an international network of collaborators.
